PygmalionAI is an open-source effort to create large language models (LLMs) for chatting and role-playing purposes. Our aim is to create LLMs that can offer interactions mimicking human behaviour as closely as possible.

## Who are we?

The PygmalionAI team is comprised of three individuals:
- TearGosling (Models & Training Code)
- Alpin (Models & Misc.)
- Tav (Community/PR Manager)
